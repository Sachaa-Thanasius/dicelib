# dicelib

## Note: Obviously, this is a fork and the original implementation is not mine. Tried to give credit to Michael Hall wherever relevant while I'm messing around.

Various stuff for handling dice. Reimplementation of older work is a WIP.

Math heavy parts re-implemented in zig rather than depending on numba for speed.
